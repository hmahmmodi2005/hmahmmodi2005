# Welcome to my GitHub Page
I am a 3rd year student at Cegep Heritage College, pursuing an Dioploma of College Studies in Computer Science.
I share some of my projects and assignments from school in my repository.
I use what I learn in my classes to create these projects and share them with the world. :shipit:
