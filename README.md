# Welcome to my GitHub Page
I am student at Cegep Heritage College, pursuing an education in their 3 year compressed Computer Science program.
I share some of my projects and assignments in my repository, my projects use Java, Javascript, Oracle, SQL Server, HTML & CSS, PHP, C#.
I use what I learn in my programs to create these projects and share them with the world. :shipit:


For the JAC project, go to both the client folder and the server folder and in the terminal write 
```
npm run dev
```
